3D Printer Comparison
=====================

  Here is a summary of the current generation of 3D printers, sorted by price. Unless otherwise stated, each machine can be assembled in a weekend, has a resolution of 100 microns, a build speed on 80mm/s, can use ABS or PLA, and ships in 4-6 weeks and is open source.

  * For largest build volume and fastest speed, get the Ultimaker ($1599) or build the rostock $(599)
  * For highest resolution, best quality and complexity, buy the Form1 ($2699)
  * For quickest support response, buy the Replicator2 ($2599)
  * For lowest price, get the PrintrBot+ ($714) or build a Rostock

  Other printers considered but not included are UP!, SUMPOD, RepRap Huxley.

Solidoodle [$599]()
===================

  * 3.6L build volume
  * Ships in December

Rostock [$599]()
================

  * 16L build volume
  * 800mm/s build speed

  Delta printer, that is 50% made of 3D-printable parts. Fastest printer ever, very simple parts.


PrintrBot+ [$714](http://printrbot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_1089.jpg)
=================

  * based on reprap
  * 8.4L build volume

  The PrintrBot+ has a huge build volume, and is based on reprap so it will be easy to improve parts. There is a pre-assembled version that costs $250 more, but its out of stock right now. It has great documentation and a small but growing community. Open source.

Bukobot [$1100]()
=================

  * 8L build volume
  * Ships in December

  Next generation of RepRap machines. Super open source, simple to assemble.

Ultimaker [$1599]()
===================

  * 9L build volume
  * 6-8 weeks delivery

  Super fast print speeds with great resolution. Beats the replicator in resolution, volume, speed, price. People have gotten prints down to 20 micron! Completely open source software/hardware.

Makerbot Replicator 2 [$2599]()
===============================

  * 1 year limited parts replacement
  * pre-assembled
  * 6.8L build volume

  Makerbot's got brand recognition, and they are from Brooklyn. The Replicator is partially closed source, so repairs are more difficult and will be obsolete more quickly. Lots of people have experience with the Replicator 1 however. Custom software.

B9Creator [$2600]()
===================

  * 50 micron resolution
  * 1.6L build volume
  * Ships in December

  No support material needed, since it does not use FDM. Best quality prints by far of any printer I have ever touched. Layering non-existant and complex internal geometries are easy. Fully open source.

Form1 [$2699]()
===============

  * 25 micron resolution
  * pre-assembled
  * 2.6L build volume
  * Ships in April

  No support material needed, since it does not use FDM. Best quality prints by far of any printer I have ever touched. Layering non-existant and complex internal geometries are easy. Custom software.


3DTouch [$4,434]()
==================

  * 3 print-heads
  * pre-assembled
  * 10.2L build volume
  * 125 micron resolution
  * Supports soluble PLA

  The 3Dtouch supports soluble PLA, so you can have support material that gets disolved cleanly. Three print-heads means more complex objects can be made.
